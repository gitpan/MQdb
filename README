README for MQdb.pm

MQdb.pm is a base toolkit for working with relational databases in the context
of a federation of object databases. It provides some base federation support
and a variation on an Object-relational-mapped template model.
Currently it supports mysql, oracle, and sqlite.
In theory it can also be used as a base object class for federation
without using relational databases.
